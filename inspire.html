    <p>Peyton Manning also known as <strong>"The Sheriff"</strong> is by far the best football player to ever play the game. The way he could call and change plays at the line has yet to be done as good as Peyton could by any other QB including Tom Brady. With two Super Bowls won and with 5 MVP awards, Peyton truley changed the sport of football.</p>
    <p>Peyton inspires me by the dedication he had for the game. He proves how with enough work and dedication, you can accomplish much more than what you may think. He always worked to be the best and always went above and beyond. One should always strive to be the best, not average.</p>
