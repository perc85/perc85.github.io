        <h1>Lowest Prices</h1>
            <p>Walmart has some of the lowest prices compared to other retail stores</p>
            <p>Since Walmart is such a big corporation, it can manage to make prices lower and the amount of sales they achieve allows them to do that!</p>
            <img alt="Price Match" class="centerimg" src="../images/price.jpg">
            <p>Walmart would go as far as even price matching other retail stores coupons</p>
            <p>Walmarts slogan "Save Money. Live Better." even includes the fact that their prices are some of the best</p>
            <p>Their main goal is to be able to provide merchandise, at the best price possible</p>
